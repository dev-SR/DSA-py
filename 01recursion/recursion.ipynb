    "`Recursion` is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking a problem into smaller instances of the same problem (also called `subproblems`) until we get a small enough **subproblem having a trivial solution**. We can say that recursion is “defining a problem in terms of itself” as it involves a function calling itself with a base case to terminate the infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts Of A Recursive Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Base Case`:It is that step where we have to stop recursion and whose value we know beforehand.Therefore while writing any recursive algorithm the first step is to figure out its base case.For example:While finding the factorial of a number, the base case is `fact(1)=1` since(`1! = 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Recursive Call`:Here we keep on dividing the problems into subproblems until we reach the base case.Once we reach the base case we start combining the solution of all the subproblems to get to the solution of the main problem.For example : while computing the factorial of a number the recursive call is `fact(n)=n*fact(n-1)`\n",

    "## Recursion vs. Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recap what we already know first. What is recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simply, recursion is a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is almost always compared to iteration, which is also a loop. If recursion and iteration are both loops, how are they different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at two of the most prominent differences between recursion and iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Recursion takes additional stack space` — We know that recursion takes extra memory stack space for each recursive calls, thus potentially having larger space complexity vs. iteration.\n",
    "- `Recursion enables cleaner, more readable code` — Despite requiring more space, using recursion can allow your code to be a lot more readable vs. iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Two Phases of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that the two phases that we are going to look at is not the two cases of recursion that we are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **the base case**\n",
    "- **the recursive case**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Recursion is a function that repeatedly calls itself in smaller forms with the idea that a complex problem can be solved more easily by solving a smaller version of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What recursion is doing is repeated calling a smaller and smaller version of itself, until you have the smallest possible case that is so small that you can simply solve it immediately → this smallest case is the base case. Then you use the answer to this base case to answer the next smallest problem, and then the next, and then the next, and so on, until you are back to the original problem that you began with.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice the two phases of recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have one phase going toward the base case.\n",
    "- We have another phase coming back from the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase of going from the original recursive call toward the base case is called the **calling phase**.\n",
    "The second phase of coming back from the base case to the original recursive call is called the **returning phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the main difference between recursion and iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration only has a `calling phase`, while recursion has a `calling phase` and a `returning phase`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason recursion is difficult to fully grasp at first, is that the loop of recursion has two phases, and this makes it difficult to see the full combining effect of each recursive call’s results into the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For iteration, this is simple because the loop goes just one way → _you simply do the same thing in every iteration, period_.\n",

    "\n",
    "For recursion, I have denoted `“op”` with a question mark. This is because in recursion, we have two phases and _a recursive call’s operation can be performed either in the calling phase_ or in the _returning phase_, depending on how the recursion function is designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When operations are performed in the `calling phase`, **they are performed as soon as the recursive call is made**. This is similar to how iteration works. The operation is done first, and then its inner recursive call is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the operation is performed in the `returning phase`, **recursive calls are made first**. When a recursive call is made, it first calls its inner recursive call, which calls its own inner recursive call, and so on until the final recursive call with the base case is made. Then, as the recursion returns back toward the original recursive call, operations for each recursive call that have been waiting for the preceding recursive call operation to terminate, are now performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the key to fully understanding how the results of each recursive call is combined into the final result: we need to understand WHEN the operations of each recursive call is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursion is like Inception\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have watched the movie `Inception`, you will notice a striking similarity between recursion and inception. ***Dream within a dream within a dream vs. recursive call within a recursive call within a recursive call.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***With a specific goal in mind, you devise a dream and go into it.*** Inside that dream, you create another dream and go into that, and then another dream inside that dream, and so on until you go into an innermost dream. This is the **calling phase**, or **going-into-the-dreams phase**. The innermost dream is the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Now, to achieve your goals and live a happy life back in reality, you have to come out of the dreams***. You must first awake from the innermost dream, then the dream above that, and then the one above that, and so on until you are finally back out into reality. This is the **returning phase**, or **coming-back-to-reality** phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the final result of the recursion is achieved depends on how the operations of each recursion call are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There can be two ways to achieve your goals through inception:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***You can perform the necessary operations for each dream as you go in to the innermost dream***. When you have reached the innermost dream, you have *already done all of the necessary operations for each dream*. All you need to do now is to simply awake from each dream like bam bam bam until you are back out into reality. **Notice the order of goals achieved: the goal for the outermost dream is achieved first and the innermost dream last.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Or, you can first go into the innermost dream by entering through all the dreams, and then perform necessary operations as you awake from the dreams***. After achieving your goal for the innermost dream, you awake from that dream. Inside the next dream, you again perform your necessary operations and achieve your goal for that dream. You will continue these operations for each dream until you are awake from the last dream that you began with, and back out into reality. **Notice the order of goals achieved: the goal for the innermost dream is achieved first and the outermost dream last.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also combine these two ways. You can perform some operations on your way into inner dreams and perform some others as you come out of the dreams. For example, you can set up some bombs in a dream on your way into the innermost dream, and then as you awake from the dreams and reach this dream again on your way out to reality, you can trigger the bomb to explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you can notice in this inception analogy is that *how the inception is designed (or how the recursion is designed) affects how your goal is achieved*. To put it another way, your inception or recursion function should be designed in a specific way, including the timing of operations, to achieve your intended goals."
